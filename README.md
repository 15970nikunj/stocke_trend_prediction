how prediction works is when 100 days ma is below 200 days ma then trend is down
if 100 days ma is above 200 days ma then trend is up(ma stands for moving avg)
the 100-day moving average suggests a medium-term bullish trend. If the price is above the 200-day moving average, it signifies a long-term uptrend in the market.
